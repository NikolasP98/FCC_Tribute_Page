				<h2>A brief history of Nelson Mandela's life:</h2>
				<p>
					Nelson Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 within the Thembu
					tribe in the South African village of Mvezo. Here he was
					raised and recieved formal education in a missionary school.
					<br />
					Nelson excelled in his grades and got involved in politics
					later in his life. He knew that people of color were being
					abused in his country, so he stopped at nothing to change
					this.
					<br />
					Shortly after, Mandela was arrested by the South African
					government, controlled by the Apartheid. He spent the next
					27 years in prison.
					<br />
					Many rebellions and uprisings took place during his time in
					prison. These desparate acts of freedom bacame more intense
					as time went on. Nelson Mandela became the symbol of freedom
					in South Africa, where citizens fought for his freedom.
					<br />
					Nelson was freed in 1990, at the age of 71. His release
					meant the fall of Apartheid and the rise of a multiculturale
					regime.
					<br />
					4 years after his release, he was elected president by the
					people. He is recognized as the first black leader of this
					country. After serving his years in South Africa's
					presidency, Mandela settled down and died in 2013 from a
					lung infection.
